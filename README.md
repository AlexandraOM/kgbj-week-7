# PROCESS

- We spent Wednesday afternoon deciding on our theme which didn't take too much time (after forcing another group to change their plan!)
- Then we drew out wireframes so that we had a decided layout from the start
- We also drew out the relationships between each module to help decide on our schema
- In pairs we built the database and set up the server/handler

- On Thursday we had a good basis to begin with the getData and postData files
- Then we spent the rest of the day mobbing the set up of the test environment and rest of the postData
- After sorting out some problems, we had the rest of the afternoon to finish our styling and adding some extra features
